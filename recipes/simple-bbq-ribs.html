            <ol>
                <li>
                    Gather all ingredients. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place ribs in a large pot and cover with water. Stir in kosher salt, garlic powder, and pepper, and bring water to a boil over medium heat. Continue to boil until ribs are tender, 40 to 45 minutes. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    While the ribs are boiling, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove ribs from the pot, and place them in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour barbeque sauce over ribs. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until the internal temperature of the pork has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 1 to 1 1/2 hours. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve hot and enjoy!

            <p>
                This BBQ ribs recipe may be different than others you've tried, but for super tender ribs, give it a try! Lean, country-style pork ribs are boiled in seasoned water until tender, then finished up in the oven under a blanket of your favorite barbecue sauce as they bake to perfection. That's it! Back to simplicity, back to country life.
