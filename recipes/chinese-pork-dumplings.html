            <ol>
                <li>
                    To make the dipping sauce: Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, chives, sesame seeds, and chile-garlic sauce in a small bowl. Set aside. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make the dumplings: Mix pork, garlic, egg, chives, soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon about 1 tablespoon of filling in the middle. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wet the edge with a little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the dumpling. Repeat to form remaining dumplings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour in 1 cup of water; cover and cook until dumplings are tender and pork is cooked through, about 5 minutes. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat to cook remaining dumplings, adding more oil and water for each batch. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve dumplings with dipping sauce. 
                </li>
